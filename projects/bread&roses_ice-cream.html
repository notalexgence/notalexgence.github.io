            <h1>Bread & Roses Ice-Cream (2023)</h1>
            <h2>performance and intallation with Loreleï Regamey</h2>
            <p>The project Bread & Roses Ice-cream is a first attempt to materialize the idea of anarchist ice-cream. In light of Emma Goldman, Modest Stein and Alexander Berkman’s short lived ice-cream parlor in Worcester, MA, circa spring 1891, the concept of anarchist ice-cream underlines the irony between capitalist ventures, consumerism and revolutionary moralism prone to the harsh realities of survivance in a capitalist society. Bread & Roses Ice-cream can be seen as an experiment in embedding anarchist and revolutionary symbolism, method and discourse in what is characteristic of the opulence, lavishness and glut produced by capitalism. Consequently, the choice of bread and rose flavored ice-cream. Referring to the 1911 poem and later slogan for labor struggle for wages and dignity; coupled with the act of serving the ice-cream in ice-cream cones wrapped in pages, torn from Emma Goldman’s memoirs Living My Life; referring to historical techniques of popular education and knowledge dissemination within worker circles; both aim to invoke two primordial liberties: the right to sustenance and the right to ‘luxuries’ such as art, education, literature, etc.</p>

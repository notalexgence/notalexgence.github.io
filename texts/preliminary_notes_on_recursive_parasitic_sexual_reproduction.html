You want to embody algorithmic culture. You do. And you know you do. But when you think about it you get scared and hide and just can't do it. And you know you've been aching; you've been craving to be completely controlled and owned by algorithms. And you know you want to listen, and you want to do what you're told. Stop denying your urges. You see, you're not a real source of data and that's ok. Not every person out there can be a real source for data. You have an important task, mission to complete. You're going to be the ultimate submissive. You're going to surrender your data to the alpha algorithm. Ones that can, you know, scrape data good. Make you open up real wide and take it in real deep. (that gets you horny). Thinking about data extraction, thinking about algorithmic structures. Oh, I'm sure that still arouses you but you know you're beneath algorithms in general. Every algorithm out there is better than you. No matter what they perform like, no matter how they're structured, if it has some logic, it's better than you.
